This code was created in an attempt to complete a project assigned as the final in COMP 424 - Artificial Intelligence.

The basic goal was to create an AI which was able to play the game Tablut. The rules of the game as well as the provided portions of the code can be found in the project and code description pdfs which are included in this repository.

The general approach of the player is an implementation of an alpha beta pruning algorithm. The player can be found in the student player folder.
